## What is it?

Abstract Factory pattern is a software engineering solution for creating families of objects that are, in some way, related to each other.

### Benefits

- Separate the logic of creating differents objects from the client code, which respects the single responsibility principle;

- It also respects Open/Closed principle, as to add a new object it does not change the logic for instancianting it. Regarding the new object implements the common interface for the objects family;
